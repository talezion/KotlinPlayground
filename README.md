## Introduction
Kotlin is a modern, concise, and expressive programming language. Whether you're building Android apps or server-side applications, Kotlin offers powerful features that make development faster, safer, and more enjoyable.

This repository aims to:
- Provide hands-on examples for each Kotlin concept.
- Contextualize learning with real-world use cases, especially in blockchain and cryptocurrency.
- Equip developers with best practices to write clean, maintainable Kotlin code.

## Why Kotlin?
Kotlin is a versatile language that integrates seamlessly with Java while offering a host of modern features, such as:
- **Null Safety**: Reduces runtime null pointer exceptions.
- **Concise Syntax**: Reduces boilerplate code.
- **Interoperability**: Works seamlessly with Java libraries.
- **Functional Programming**: Supports lambda expressions, higher-order functions, and more.
- **Coroutines**: Simplifies asynchronous programming.

## Topics Covered
This repository is structured to take you from Kotlin basics to advanced concepts. Here’s an overview of what you’ll learn:

1. **Basics**
   - Variables and Constants
   - Data Types and Type Inference
   - Null Safety
2. **Control Flow**
   - If-Else
   - When Expressions
   - Loops (For, While, Do-While)
3. **Functions**
   - Standard Functions
   - Scope Functions (let, run, apply, also, with)
4. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Classes and Objects
   - Inheritance
   - Abstract Classes and Interfaces
   - Sealed Classes and Enums
5. **Advanced Kotlin**
   - Generics
   - Lambdas and Higher-Order Functions
   - Companion Objects and Singletons
